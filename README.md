*Please note*
-------------------------------------------
This project isn't intended to be found and worked on by others, but if you've stumbled upon this
feel free to use this code/project however you'd like.   
(I'm an amateur programmer so I wouldn't recommend this as a source to learn from yourself).  
  
I'd appreciate any pointers or help given.   
This project is mainly being used as a learning experience to base future projects on.


Currently Implemented:
----------------------
-Rudimentary tile map  
-loading a small sprite sheet  
-camera pan/zoom  
-player movement/collisions (collisions need to be revised)  
-rudimentary Dijkstra pathtracking implementation (needs heavy revisions)
